<!--

Thank you in advance for your contribution. We consider any issue, from a small
bug report to a large feature request, an important community contribution.

If you are **not** submitting a bug report for React Apollo you may delete this
template and write your issue.

If you are submitting a bug report before you open the issue please take a few
minutes and try to reproduce your error using the
[`react-apollo-error-template`][1]. This will go a _long_ way in helping the
React Apollo community debug your error and create a timely fix. Without a small
test case reproducing your error it will take a lot of time communicating to
pinpoint the exact problem you are having. By submitting your bug report with a
test case the React Apollo community can identify and fix your bug much faster.
